 **   This program takes the hours worked and hourly rate of       **
 **   an employee and computes the gross pay earned.               **
 **   Federal deductions are computed as 29% of gross pay.         **
 **   Finally the take-home pay or net pay is computed by          **
 **   subtraction deductions from gross pay.                       **
 **                                                                **
